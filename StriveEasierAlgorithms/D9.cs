/*
    Module 9 - Day 9 | Binary Search

    # Implement your own version of Binary Search  #
    
    Extend our StriveEasierAlgorithms project [https://github.com/danielebanovaz/StriveEasierAlgorithms]
    by adding a class that's capable of finding an item inside an array or list of integers
    by using the Binary Search algorithm

    You can use this sample collection, taken from the slides:

    List<int> collectionToSearchIn = new List<int>() {  5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 24, 25, 27, 29, 34, 35, 39 };

    We want to output the index of the number we are looking for, and the total amount of iterations it took


    # Optional #

    Try to integrate smoothly inside our current user interface

    The user can be asked for numbers to fill the collection with, and then the number to search for
